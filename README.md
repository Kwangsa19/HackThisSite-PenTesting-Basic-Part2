## Basic - Level 6

### Scenario 6:

`Network Security Sam has encrypted his password. The encryption system is publically available and can be accessed with this form |Form Box|
You have recovered his encrypted password. It is c:94jgj7. Decrypt the password to advance to the next level : | Answer Form | 
`

### Solutions
1. Try to put `11111` on the encryption system form box. The encryption result is `12345`.

2. For every string that we put here, the system will convert it according to its value in ASCII table. Please have a look at [ASCII Table](https://www.asciitable.com/). To put it simply or what everyone has been saying: <br>
`The first one will be decremented by 0.` <br>
`The second will be decremented by 1.` <br>
`The third will be decremented by 2 and so on.`

|Character|ASCII value|New ASCII|Corresponds|
|---|---|---|---|
|c|99|99-0 = 99|remains `c`|
|:|58|58-1 = 57| `9`|
|9|57|57-2 = 55| `7`|
|4|52|52-3 = 49| `1`|
|j|106|106-4 = 102| `f`|
|g|103|103-5 = 98| `b`|
|j|106|106-6 =100| `d`|
|7|55|55-7 =48| `0`|


3. By following that logic, we get the result of `c971fbd0`. Write it on the `|Answer Form|`.



### Recommendation
1. Hashing: Changing the encryption key dynamically.
2. Salting: Adding randomness to make it harder to break.
